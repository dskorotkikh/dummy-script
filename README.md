Some dummy scripts for some dummy things

Try factorize number into 2 prime number p and q. Algo get  O(n^(0.25)) time and memory (it allows me factorise 114-bit number on my laptop)

INPUT :

n - number for factorization

scale - upper bound ratio between p and q (for RSA key it's 2, but you can try use more lower bound, because it make calculation more efficient)
